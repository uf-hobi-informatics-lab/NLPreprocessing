Radiology : CXR 11 - 16 : Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields bilaterally .
In an immunocompromised patient , this is concerning for PCP Name Initial ( PRE ) 2 .
Radiographically , the differential includes pulmonary edema .
Additionally , there is a faint opacity at the right lung base , which may represent atelectasis or focal pneumonic process .
.
CT - Head 11 - 16 : Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical white matter of the right medial frontal lobe .
This may represent a subacute infarction; however , an underlying mass lesion cannot be completely excluded .
An MRI examination with gadolinium and diffusion - weighted imaging is recommended for further evaluation .
No intracranial hemorrhage noted .
.
MR - head - w&w/o gadolinium 11 - 18 : Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement .
This finding most likely represent a small infarct .
However , in absence of ADC map , age of the infarct could not be determined .
No abnormal enhancement is seen .
Follow up is suggested , if clinically indicated .
.
Echo 11 - 18 : 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated .
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 55 % ) .
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
4. The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve .
There is no aortic valve stenosis .
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen .
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve .
While difficult to assess given the limited views suspect Mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
6. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal .
7. There is no pericardial effusion .
.
If clinically indicated , would recommend a TEE .
.
CXR 11 - 21 : Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
Studies : EEG 11 - 17 : This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing - all consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic , metabolic , or anoxic etiology .
No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen .
Brief Hospital Course : A/P : 54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC ( prednisone , 6MP ) who presents with new onset HA , fever with bacterial meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia .
.
# .
Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia .
Patient presented with headache , nuchal rigidity , expressive aphasia , afebrile on admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED , where she also started to have rigors .
LP showed > 300 WBC , poly predominant with 5 % monocytes , protein 152 glucose 16 .
CSF gram stain showed gram positive rods , blood culture grew gram positive rods , speciation eventually grew listeria .
Empiric treatment based on gram stain was started : ampicillin and bactrim ( to cover both nocardia and question of PCP , Name10 ( NameIs ) 3 below ) , vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending confirmation of gram stain and culture results .
Once speciations was confirmed , a five day course of gentamicin was started for synergy , and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c ' d.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
Name Initial ( PRE ) 4 11 - 21 , when it was changed to prophylaxis dose .
Early on admission , she developed hypotension that required levophed , but was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of admission with PRBCs ( total of 4 units ) and volume resussitation .
Given bacteremia , TTE was done , no vegetations or lesions noted .
Head CT on admission showed right medial frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion , no hemorrhage .
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct , unclear date , and EEG consistent with meningitis .
Neurology was consulted , and the patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given meningoencephalitis .
She spiked fevers to 101 - 102 over the first several days of admission .
By 11 - 19 , her neurological exam was markedly improved , and by 11 - 21 her headache was gone , no meningeal signs noted , although her baseline essential tremor was slightly more severe .
Surveillance blood cultures reamined negative from 11 - 17 on .
Notably , she was transferred from ICU to floor on 11 - 21 , but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d , patient mentating well , sent back to ICU .
In the ICU , an arterial line was placed , and consistently read 20 - 30 mmHg higher than sphyngomanometer .
This discrepancy was of unclear etiology , but persistent .
Patient maintained normal mentation , good urine output , no tachycardia , and it was judged that , for some unclear reason , the cuff pressures underestimated by 20 - 30 points .
On 11 - 23 , she was sent to the floor for further care and management .
.
# .
Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia .
Initial chest film read as increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP ( given steroids and no PCP Name Initial ( PRE ) 5 ) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema .
She had signifcant oxygen requirement , and her respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP + PS .
The origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP .
Name10 ( NameIs ) 6 induced sputum was attempted , but was unsuccessful , and was not repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status , and susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small .
She responded well to lasix diuresis , with reduced O2 requirements .
.
# .
UC : She continued to receive her outpatient dose of prednisone , which was changed on 11 - 22 to dexamethasone IV; her outpatient 6 - MP was held .
After several days with no diarrhea , it recurred on 11 - 22 soon after her diet had advanced .
C.diff was negative .
She was made NPO , and fed via TPN for bowel rest .
On 11 - 24 , it was noted that she began passing BRBRP , her hematocrit was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and consent for blood transfusion .
.
# .
Anemia .
On admission , she was found to be anemic .
She received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again 11 - 19 for mixed venous sat < 70 % .
She was found to have iron binding studies c/w anemia of chronic disease .
Her HCT was followed closely , and remained stable for the remainder of her admission .
.
# .
FEN : Her diet was advanced as tolerated , but she was made NPO with TPN on 11 - 22 after she developed diarrhea , thought secondary to continued UC activity .
.
# .
Prophylaxis : PPI .
Hold SQ Hep , pneumoboots .
Initially on droplet precautions .

Surgery Discharge part : Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on 2147 - 11 - 26 .
She was on Clinda/Gent peri - procedure and Amplicillin for 21 days at first .
She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until the ostomy started to function .
SHe had c/o nausea as diet was tolerated and it was slowed down .
MRI was suspicious for an abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6 weeks as per ID .
She was given a PICC .
On 12 - 5 she was cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on 2147 - 12 - 5 .
